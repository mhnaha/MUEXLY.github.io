My name is Mohammad and I am currently a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at Clemson University

I joined the group in Spring 2022 performing Theoretical studies and molecular dynamics simulations to run Computational Mechanics and Materials Science projects.

I am currently working on the following topics:

- Radiation Induced Segregation in Structural Composition-Aware Alloys 
- Rate of Reaction analysis in Dislocation Obstacle bypass
- Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations
- Rate of Reaction in Grain Boundary Migration
- Dislocation Dipole Fluctuations and Langevin Damping Effects on Rate prediction
